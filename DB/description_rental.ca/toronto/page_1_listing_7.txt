Living at High Park Village in Toronto's High Park neighbourhood means you'll be steps away from Keele or High Park subway stops on the TTC, and 15 minutes from Lake Shore Boulevard and The Queensway. Live with schools, boutiques, markets, and local restaurants nearby in The Junction and Roncesvalles.
Enjoy renovated spacious suites, each with a private balcony, as you live down the block from High Park with its famous trails, dog parks, and even a zoo. Take advantage of an annual farmers market every Saturday in the summer months at the Junction Farmers Market, or step outside your door to explore a local on-premises seasonal farmers market on Thursdays from 3 - 7 PM.
Let us help you determine the best way for you to discover your new home. Whether you prefer a virtual, self-guided, or in-person tour, we are happy to help you explore. Rent safely with Minto Apartments.
