All the perks of townhome living without the stress of homeownership.  Modern 1 2, 3 & 4 bedroom Townhomes in Prairie Pointe/ Waverley West. There comes a point when you're tired of renting a suite in a large block with neighbours all-round, shared entrances, long waits for elevators and not enough private space or gardens. That's why we've created a townhome community that offers the lifestyle you're looking for â€“ private entrances, private gardens and balconies, gourmet kitchens, and welcoming, multi-level living with large, light rooms.
We offer signature care for you and your likeminded neighbours. So stop worrying about parking problems and boring spaces and start living the lifestyle you deserve. 
Enjoy bright, open-concept floorplans, filled with the very best in modern finishes. Each home includes its own individual entrance, private outdoor space, in-suite washer/dryer, laminate flooring, and stainless steel appliances.
